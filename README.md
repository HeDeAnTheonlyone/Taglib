Taglib is, as the name already said, a tags library.

It currently adds 232 new blocks, entity, and item tags for you to use.
With this library, you're prepared for everything you possibly wanna do in your data packs.

I will add new tags every week one or more times to make it the biggest and best tags library to ever existed
and to eventually cover everything you could potentially need.

If you consider using this library in your data pack please credit me.
